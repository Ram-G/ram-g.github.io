I am a software engineer by training and profession. I am a son, a brother, and a friend. I am a problem-solver and a cultivator of ideas. I am a lover of all things beautiful; a lifelong student. I am an amateur philosopher; first and foremost of human nature - I believe that human nature is the one constant (figuratively) in a world where delta(entropy) > 0. I am a dabbler among other things in psychology, theology, economics, politics; in all manners of questions that pertain to our understanding of human society and the Universe - what is the basis of humanity's fundamental moral systems? As Einstein discovered special and general relativity, is it also the case that everything tangible is also relative? (_prima facie_, I think the answer is yes). I am a former professional chess player.

This blog, I expect, will contain in large part my musings on the transient and scintillating beauty of human nature - of our, humans', interactions with each other, and the world. I often in thought-exercises find myself coming back to the constant of human nature as an explanation for phenomena small and big. Perhaps it's to do with my childhood love for Agatha Christie; as Miss Marple very simply puts it - "Human nature is much the same everywhere."

Some of my favorite quotes, in no particular order:

_"All that is gold does not glitter"_ – J.R.R. Tolkien

_"Human nature is much the same everywhere."_ – Miss Marple 

_"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena."_ – Theodore Roosevelt

_"There will be no end to the troubles of states, or of humanity itself, till philosophers become kings in this world, or till those we now call kings and rulers really and truly become philosophers, and political power and philosophy thus come into the same hands."_ – Plato
